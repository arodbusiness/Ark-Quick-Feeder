# Ark-Quick-Feeder

This script will press F to access an inventory, type the "SearchString" variable into the search bar, and transfer all to other inventory. Be sure to specificy the search string depending on the dino you are feeding. For example, "rr" for berries for herbivores or "raw" for meat for carnivores. The script will also check that it is still in the inventory before taking any actions. This should help with lag spikes and user miss key presses. 

XButton2 on your mouse is used to trigger the action. If you would like to use this script by manually entering and exiting an inventory, comment out the lines 13 and 23-25.
